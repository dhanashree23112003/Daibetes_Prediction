Diabetes Prediction Model
Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict diabetes in patients using the Diabetes dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The model utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to perform the prediction.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1), 0 means non-diabetic and 1 means diabetic
Requirements
Python 3.6+
NumPy
scikit-learn
